    "MongoDB Atlas Search makes it easy to build fast, relevant, full-text search capabilities on top of your data in MongoDB Atlas. With search built directly into Atlas, there's no need to replicate data to separate search platform that needs to be set up, maintained, and scaled. Atlas Search is built on top of [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/), the industry standard library for full-text Search.\n",
